## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I currently work with Ruby/Rails.  See my [work profile](https://github.com/ctreptow).

### However

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [AWS DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/)
ðŸŒ± ...with occasional sidebars into [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [nix](https://nixos.org/), ?  
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on two things: code: a ray tracer in Python and devops: building and deploying a website to AWS using Docker, etc.  
ðŸ“« How to reach me: craig AT craigtreptow DOT com, or [my very small website](https://craigtreptow.com/)
